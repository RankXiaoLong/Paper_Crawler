> Normalization Layers (NLs) are widely used in modern deep-learning architectures. Despite their apparent simplicity, their effect on optimization is not yet fully understood. This paper introduces a spherical framework to study the optimization of neural networks with NLs from a geometric perspective. Concretely, the radial invariance of groups of parameters, such as filters for convolutional neural networks, allows to translate the optimization steps on the $L_2$ unit hypersphere. This formulation and the associated geometric interpretation shed new light on the training dynamics. Firstly, the first effective learning rate expression of Adam is derived. Then the demonstration that, in the presence of NLs, performing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) alone is actually equivalent to a variant of Adam constrained to the unit hypersphere, stems from the framework. Finally, this analysis outlines phenomena that previous variants of Adam act on and their importance in the optimization process are experimentally validated.

> Ferrous metal futures have become unique commodity futures with Chinese characteristics. Due to the late listing time, it has received less attention from scholars. Our research focuses on the volatility spillover effects, defined as the intensity of price volatility in financial instruments. We use DCC-GARCH, BEKK-GARCH, and DY(2012) index methods to conduct empirical tests on the volatility spillover effects of the Chinese ferrous metal futures market and other parts of the Chinese commodity futures market, as well as industries related to the steel industry chain in stock markets. It can be seen that there is a close volatility spillover relationship between ferrous metal futures and nonferrous metal futures. Energy futures and chemical futures have a significant transmission effect on the fluctuations of ferrous metals. In addition, ferrous metal futures have a significant spillover effect on the stock index of the steel industry, real estate industry, building materials industry, machinery equipment industry, and household appliance industry. Studying the volatility spillover effect of the ferrous metal futures market can reveal the operating laws of this field and provide ideas and theoretical references for investors to hedge their risks. It shows that the ferrous metal futures market has an essential role as a "barometer" for the Chinese commodity futures market and the stock market.
