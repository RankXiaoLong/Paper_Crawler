> N.L. Johnson and S. Kotz introduced in 1990 an interesting family of symmetric distributions which is based on randomly weighted average from uniform random samples. The only example that could be addressed to their work is the so-called "uniformly randomly modified tin" distribution from which two random samples have been computed. In this paper, we generalize a subfamily of their symmetric distributions and identify a concrete instance of this generalized subfamily. That instance turns out to belong to the family of Johnson and Kotz, which had not seemingly received proper attention in the literature.
